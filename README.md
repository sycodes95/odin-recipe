# odin-recipes
This project is going to be about my personal recipes for various foods and supplements. 
The skills I am going to be demonstrating will be the ability to create a barely passable website using my recently learned and limited knowledge of html (though you might be impressed by the recipes I will unleash). I will include descriptions, lists, and pictures for all recipes.
